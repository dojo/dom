The `dojo-dom` package provides utilities for DOM manipulation and event handling/delegation in browser runtimes.
It encourages (and shims) standard DOM methods where possible, but also provides utilities to make
common and recommended use cases easy and obvious, and harder use cases less painful.

**WARNING** This is *alpha* software. It is not yet production ready, so you should use at your own risk.

## Features

### DOM Manipulation

* `dom.applyFeatureClass` - accepts any number of feature test names (registered with the `has` module), and adds
corresponding classes to the document element.
* `dom.byId` - Retrieves an element by ID (shorthand for `document.getElementById`)
* `dom.contains` - Determines if an element contains a given node
* `dom.create` - Creates an element
* `dom.fromString` - Creates an element or elements from a string of HTML
* `dom.remove` - Detaches a node from its parent
* `dom.place` - Places a node relative to another element

### CSS Class Manipulation

The class manipulation APIs provide analogues to the `DOMTokenList` API.  They will delegate to `classList`
when available, adding logic when necessary to comply with the more recent parts of the standard
(e.g. multiple add/remove arguments, optional force parameter for toggle).

* `dom.addClass` - Adds one or more classes to an element
* `dom.containsClass` - Tests if a particular class exists on an element
* `dom.removeClass` - Removes one or more classes from an element
* `dom.toggleClass` - Toggles a class on an element, optionally accepting a boolean to specifically add or remove

### CSS Style Manipulation

The dom package provides the `addCssRule` function for adding styles *in a stylesheet*, rather than inline.  This allows
styles to be added programmatically on a per-selector basis, which is often more flexible and efficient than
setting styles directly inline on one element. When used, `addCssRule` returns a handle that allows the rules for the provided selector to be manipulated.

The dom package does *not* provide helpers for setting inline styles, as `element.style` generally accomplishes that,
but moreover, inline styles should be discouraged as they override stylesheets and can be difficult to maintain.


### Form Manipulation

These APIs are implemented in a separate `dom/form` module.

* `form.fromObject` - Populates a DOM form's fields from a JavaScript object
* `form.toObject` - Serializes the values in a form into a JavaScript object

### DOM Events

The `dojo-core/on` module already contains basic support for registering and removing DOM event handlers.
The dom package adds APIs for event delegation in the `delegate` module. The `delegate` function allows an event
handler to be attached to an element in order to respond to events raised by contained elements that match the provided
selector.

NOTE: `delegate` will only respond to events raised by contained elements. It will not respond to events raised by the container itself.


### Batch Operations

There are many times when a large number of operations need to be applied to the DOM at one time. In order to enable this to be done
as efficiently as possible, the `schedule` module provides functionality to group the operations together.

* `schedule.read` - Schedules a function that will retrieve information about the DOM's current state
* `schedule.write` - Schedules a function that will update the state of the DOM

NOTE: In order to be as flexible as possible, the `read` and `write` functions define very generic interfaces. In order
to ensure that the operations are executed efficiently, it is important to use these functions only for their intended purpose.

## How do I use this package?

Users will need to download and compile directly from this repository and
[dojo/core](https://github.com/dojo/core) for the time being.
Precompiled AMD/CommonJS modules will be provided in the near future as our release tools are improved.

Once you've downloaded `dojo-core` and `dojo-dom`, perform the following steps:

```sh
cd dojo-core
grunt dist
cd dist
npm link
cd ../../dojo-dom
npm install # (if you haven't already done this)
npm link dojo-core
```

## How do I contribute?

We appreciate your interest!  Please see the [Guidelines Repository](https://github.com/dojo/guidelines#readme) for the
Contributing Guidelines and Style Guide.

## Testing

Test cases MUST be written using Intern using the Object test interface and Assert assertion interface.

90% branch coverage MUST be provided for all code submitted to this repository, as reported by istanbul’s combined coverage results for all supported platforms.
